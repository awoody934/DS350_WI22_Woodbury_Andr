Welcome to DS 350 - Data Wrangling and Visualization.

Hi, I'm studying Industrial/Organizational Psychology and I am in this class for my Data Science minor. I have had many hobbies. I like playing guitar, working on my car, hiking, creating t-shirt designs, but I now end up spending most of my time with my wife.
