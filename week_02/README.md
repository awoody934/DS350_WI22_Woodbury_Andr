# Week 2 Notes

### My 4 Questions
1) Why would a customer buy my product/service instead of a competitors?
2) Which of our products/services are selling the most?
3) Why is that product/service selling faster or more than our others?
4) Where is the best place to start a cleaning business?


## Feedback from Others
1)Try to quantify question 1 a little bit more.He thought they were all good questions to ask, but thought some might be difficult to answer. Reword question 4, it just seemed a little wordy to him. 
2)She actually had a good question that applies to her personally. She is looking to move, but she has her own business.So I decided to change my last question to the one that she had. She thought all of my other questions were good.  
3)She thought that they are all good questions, but she would have probably changed questions 2 and 3. She would have reversed them, so they would be asking which items are selling th least and why are those products selling slow.  
4)He said one of the most important things he has seen with question 1 is time. If a business doesn't have time for a customer, it is one of the biggest turnoffs. He wanted to get a motorcycle checked out and they didn't have a time slot for 2 weeks. So instead he found someone that could see him soon.
